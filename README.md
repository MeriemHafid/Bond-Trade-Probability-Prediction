# Bond-Trade-Probability-Prediction
This project analyzes bond request data to predict trade probabilities based on price differences and client behavior using logistic regression. It also clusters clients into two groups based on acceptance rates. Evaluation is done on the last 200 requests, comparing a single model for all clients with separate models for each client type.
